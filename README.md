# SwiftCS

SwiftCS is an iOS application that teaches computer science fundamentals in Swift. This app is part of my exploration into computer science. I come from a non-traditional coding background, and I want to help people in similar situations with deeper learning and when preparing for interviews. This project is on ice until further notice as I am creating content around data structures. Follow my journey on my [blog](http://www.zacharyfrew.com/blog).

## Features
* Learn about key data structures
* Explore operating system concepts
* Review common algorithms

## Architecture
* TBD: using SwiftUI 

## Dependencies
